# Access-Form-Creator
The idea behind this project is to be able to hand somebody with no understanding of access or vba code an access database that contains only what is needed to allow them to create forms, reports,and linked tables based on the information they fill out on the form provided to them. 

When the project is finished they should then be able to select whether to hide or remove everything used to create the backend they needed from within the form they fill out.

So far after filling out the form provided it creates a table, Working on loading a form based on the newly created tables. Having issues with having vba code wait till table is finished being created before pulling it to create a form.
